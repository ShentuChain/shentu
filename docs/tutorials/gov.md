## `x/gov` module

### Introduction
The Cosmos-SDK-based blockchain can now support an on-chain governance system with to this module. Holders of the chain's native staking token can vote on proposals on a 1 token, 1 vote basis in this system. The `gov` module enables on-chain governance which allows Shentu Chain token holder to participate in the decision-making processes. For example, users can:

 - Form a proposal and seek feedback.
 - Create the proposal and make any necessary changes based on feedback.
 - Submit a proposal along with a deposit.
 - Tokens must be deposited in order to fund an active proposal.
 - Vote for a proposal that is currently active.

The `gov` module currently supports these features:

 - Proposal submission: Users can submit proposals with a deposit. The proposal enters the voting session once the minimal deposit is met.
 - Voting: Participants can vote on proposals that have passed the MinDeposit requirement.
 - Inheritance and penalties: If a delegate does not vote, their validator's vote is inherited.
 - Claiming deposit: Users who made deposits on proposals can get their money back if the proposal was accepted or if the idea was never presented up for a vote.

#### The Governance Procedure in Shentu

 1. **Proposals**
	 Validators and certifiers regulate the chain by means of proposals. A proposal can be submitted by any user, but some types of proposals must be submitted by a certifier. Before a proposal can be voted on, it must first meet a minimum deposit threshold; this helps eliminate spam. The deposit is usually returned at the end of the proposal's life cycle, regardless of whether it passes or not. This deposit time is waived for proposals submitted by a validator or certifier. All three types of participants can submit a proposal: Stake Delegators, Validator Operators, and Security Certifiers.
	 
 2. **Deposit Period** 
	 In this period, the proposal has the status "PROPOSAL_STATUS_DEPOSIT_PERIOD" which indicates a proposal status during the deposit. 

	A deposit is required for Stake Delegates to submit a proposal. Once the minimum deposit is paid, the proposal will be confirmed and the voting period will begin. Depending on the type of proposal, there will be one or two voting rounds, depending on the security changes that the plan will come up. For instance, software upgrade proposals have two different voting stages and they must pass the scrutiny of both certifiers and validators while plain text proposals do not automatically trigger chain action when they pass, they just require a single validator voting period to pass.

	Stake Delegates can gain greater attention through the deposit process, which helps them get their proposals into the Voting Period. Because they have already been entrusted by delegators during the delegation and election process, Security Certifiers and Validator Operators can skip the deposit period when submitting proposals.

 3. **Voting Period**: 
	 	There are four options for voting:
	 - Yes: want the proposal to pass
	 - No: do not want the proposal to pass and want to return the deposit
	 - No with Veto: do not want the proposal to pass and opt to burn the deposit
	 - Abstain: not to participate in the vote

	Moreover, two security voting options in this procedure:
	 - Yes: want the proposal passed and there is no security issue.
	 - No / Abstain:  do not want the proposal passed or elect not to participate in the vote, and there are potential security issues.
	 
	 During the voting period, there are two passes of voting (thus the name of the dual-pass governance model) for functional and security considerations.

	In the voting period, the proposal has 2 status:

	 - `PROPOSAL_STATUS_CERTIFIER_VOTING_PERIOD`: a certifier voting period status. Certifiers can vote with two options: yes/no. Each vote is equally weighted; each certifier receives one vote. The percentage of `yes` votes out of total votes must meet a certain level. This status will be passed after the certifier votes and move to the next status;
	 
	 - `PROPOSAL_STATUS_VALIDATOR_VOTING_PERIOD`: a validator voting period status. There are four options for validators to vote: yes/no/abstain/no_with_veto. The total amount of tokens staked on the chain is used to weight each validator's vote. The proposal fails if a sufficient number of `no_with_veto` votes are cast, and the deposit is destroyed. The deposit is refunded in all other scenarios. The percentage of `yes` votes out of all non-abstinent ballots must be greater than a threshold for a proposal to pass. The proposal will fail if it does not meet the threshold.
	 
	 Only staked tokens are allowed to vote in the voting pass for practical reasons. The voting power, or influence on the decision, is determined by the quantity of tokens staked. Unless they decide to cast their own vote, which would override the Validators' voting choice, Stake Delegators adopt the vote of the Validators they have decided to delegate. On each proposal, each token is entitled to one vote.
	 
	 For the avoidance of doubt, the right to vote is limited to voting on Shentu Platform features; the right to vote does not entitle CTK holders to vote on the Foundation, its affiliates, or their assets, and it does not imply any equity interest in any of these entities.

 5. **Results**
	 There are 3 status for the voting result:

	 - `PROPOSAL_STATUS_PASSED`: a proposal status of a proposal that has passed. The number of voters vote "yes" dominates.
	 - `PROPOSAL_STATUS_REJECTED`: a proposal status of a proposal that has been rejected. The number of voters vote "no" dominates.
	 - `PROPOSAL_STATUS_FAILED`: a proposal status of a proposal that has failed.

	 If the proposal was approved as a software upgrade, nodes must update their software to the new version approved. This procedure is broken down into two parts: a signal and a switch.

	Validator Operators are expected to download and install the updated version of the software while continuing to use the old version during the signal step. When a validator node is deployed as part of the upgrade, it will begin broadcasting to the network that it is ready to switch over.

	At every one time, there is just one signal. If several software upgrade proposals are accepted in a short period of time, a pipeline will form, with each request being implemented in the sequence in which it was accepted.

	When a majority of validator nodes signal a common software upgrade proposal, all nodes (validator nodes, non-validator nodes, and light nodes) are expected to move to the new software version at the same time in the switch phase.

- `shentud tx gov submit-proposal certifier-update [proposal file] [flags]`: Submit a certifier update proposal along with an initial deposit. Certifier Update Proposals add a new certifier or remove a certifier if they pass. This proposal type must be submitted by a certifier. Its voting protocol is unique, in that it must pass either the certifier voting round or the validator voting round. The proposal details must be supplied via a JSON file. Here is a sample of a proposal for certifier update:
```
{
	"title": "New Certifier, Joe Shmoe",
	"description": "Why we should make Joe Shmoe a certifier",
	"certifier": "shentu1fdyv6hpukqj6kqdtwc42qacq9lpxm0pnggk5vn",

- `shentud tx gov submit-proposal community-pool-spend [proposal file] [flags]`: Submit a community pool spend proposal along with an initial deposit. Community Pool Spend Proposals transfer tokens from the community pool to an address if they pass. The recipient of the tokens could be a chain user who has done—or plans to do—development work or security work for the chain. The recipient could also be a smart contract that distributes the tokens to multiple addresses after conditions have been met. A community pool spend proposal only needs to pass the validator voting period. The proposal details must be supplied via a JSON file. Here is a sample of a proposal for community pool spend:
```
{
	"title": "Community Pool Spend",
	"description": "Pay me some Atoms!",
	"recipient": "shentu1s5afhd6gxevu37mkqcvvsj8qeylhn0rzawx5da",

```

- `shentud tx gov submit-proposal param-change [proposal file] [flags]`: Submit a parameter proposal along with an initial deposit. The proposal specifies the new value for the parameter as well as the parameter to be changed. A parameter change proposal, like a plain text proposal, merely goes through the validator voting phase. The proposal details must be supplied via a JSON file. For values that contains objects, only non-empty fields will be updated. Here is a sample of a proposal for parameter change:
```
# Currently parameter changes are evaluated but not validated, so it is very important that any "value" change is valid.
{
	"title": "Staking Param Change",
	"description": "Update max validators",
	"changes": [
	{
		"subspace": "staking",
		"key": "MaxValidators", #the param wants to be changed
		"value": 105
	}
	],
	"deposit": "1000stake"
}
```

Here is the transaction for the Shield claim proposal. For example, we want to change MaxValidators to 105:

- `shentud tx gov submit-proposal software-upgrade [name] (--upgrade-height [height] | --upgrade-time [time]) (--upgrade-info [info]) [flags]`: Submit a software upgrade along with an initial deposit. Please specify a unique name and height OR time for the upgrade to take effect. Software Upgrade Proposals require chain code modifications, such as changing the range/scope of the chain parameters or adding new chain features. If a software upgrade proposal passes, it will introduce a change to the chain's code that all validators must adopt. A user will usually submit a plain text proposal before submitting a software upgrade proposal to assess interest in their possible code improvement. A software update proposal must pass both a certifier and a validator voting round because software upgrades can bring security risks.
